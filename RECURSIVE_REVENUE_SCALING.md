# PROJECT MONOLITH: RECURSIVE REVENUE SCALING

This document explains the **Exponential Economic Engine**.

## 🎯 Core Concept: The Revenue Ladder

Starting from $0, the system automatically climbs through revenue stages, using earnings to unlock higher-yield opportunities.

```text
$0      → DePIN (GPU/Bandwidth)         → $40-80/day
$100    → CEX Swing Trading              → $5-20/day (additional)
$1,000  → Flash Loan Arbitrage           → $50-500/day
$10,000 → Liquidity Provision (Uniswap) → $100-1,000/day
$100,000→ Algorithmic Market Making      → $500-5,000/day
```

## 🔄 Auto-Reinvestment Logic

The `capital_allocation_agent` runs every 6 hours:

1. **Check Treasury**: Read `System/Logs/Treasury/execution_log.jsonl`
2. **Calculate Available Capital**: Sum all earnings
3. **Unlock Next Stage**: If capital ≥ stage requirement, allocate
4. **Report Progress**: Update dashboard with new revenue projection

## 📊 Example Progression

### Week 1 (Starting from $0)

- **Active**: DePIN only
- **Earnings**: $60/day × 7 = $420
- **Status**: Not enough to unlock CEX ($100 min)

### Week 2

- **Active**: DePIN + CEX (unlocked on Day 8)
- **Earnings**: $80/day × 7 = $560
- **Total Capital**: $980 (close to Flash Loan threshold)

### Week 3

- **Active**: DePIN + CEX + Flash Loans (unlocked on Day 15)
- **Earnings**: $150/day × 7 = $1,050
- **Total Capital**: $2,590

### Month 2

- **Active**: All 4 stages unlocked
- **Earnings**: $300-600/day
- **Total Capital**: $15,000+ (approaching Liquidity Provision)

### Month 6

- **Active**: All stages including Market Making
- **Earnings**: $1,000-5,000/day
- **Annual Projection**: $365K-$1.8M

## 🚀 Implementation

The system is **FULLY AUTONOMOUS**:

```python
# Runs automatically via Master Assistant
capital_agent = CapitalAllocationAgent()
capital_agent.allocate_capital(new_earnings=150)

# Output:
# [CAPITAL] 🚀 UNLOCKED: CEX_Swing_Trade ($100 allocated)
# [CAPITAL] 📊 Projection: $45-100/day
```

No human intervention required after initial DePIN setup.

## 🎓 Key Insight

**Traditional approach**: Save for 6 months, then invest.  
**Monolith approach**: Every dollar earned immediately seeks highest ROI.

Result: **Exponential growth instead of linear.**
